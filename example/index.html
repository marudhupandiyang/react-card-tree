      <h2> Simple React Card Tree example </h2>
      <p>
        <b>Problem: </b> <br />
        Lets assume you need to model a school. You would need to list all the <b>classes</b> first. Then each class would have different <b>sections</b>(like Class X-A, class X-B.. etc). Under each class you would have <b>n</b> students. This is a simple 3 level tree. So when a user selects class X, then he would be displayed with all the sections in it. And when he selects a section we would list all the students in it. The below is how it would look and the same is available under examples folder
